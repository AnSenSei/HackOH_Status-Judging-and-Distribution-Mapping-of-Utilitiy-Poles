This is the project accomplished in HackOHI/O 2020 and is for competing in the challenge of AEP challenge.
(The repo is to be uploaded and completed by judging time in the 2nd day of HackOHI/O.)
This Jupyter Notebook is for requesting AEP pole detection API. The Post send contains images and get bounding box information as return. Then the notebook uses returned info to crop the image to pop utility poles out for status prediction.
